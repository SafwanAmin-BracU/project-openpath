# **PROJECT: OPENPATH**

***Empowering CS Students to Navigate Open Source Contributions with Purpose***

## *PROJECT CONCEPT*

### *Core Concept*

OpenPath is a curated platform that bridges the gap between computer science students and open-source projects by offering personalized contribution pathways. It leverages GitHub’s API to match students with projects aligned with their skills and career goals, while tracking and validating their contributions as professional experience. The platform integrates educational scaffolding (guided learning resources, progress milestones) with real-world developer workflows to transform open-source participation into a structured, resume-worthy journey.

### *Mission Statement*

*"To democratize access to open-source ecosystems by empowering students with tailored opportunities, mentorship, and verifiable proof of their impact. We turn the chaos of scattered repositories into a guided curriculum for real-world software development."*

### *Key Features Overview*

#### *1\. Intelligent Opportunity Matching Engine*

##### Dynamic Skill-Based Filtering

* Match students to issues using multi-layered criteria: programming languages, frameworks (e.g., React, TensorFlow), project domains (e.g., healthcare, fintech), and issue labels (e.g., "good first issue").  
* Strategic Recommendations: Prioritize issues based on a student’s GitHub activity, coursework, and stated career interests (e.g., backend development, DevOps).

##### Beginner Difficulty Grading

*Auto-classify issues as Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced using metrics like:*

* Historical data on first-time contributor success rates.  
* Codebase complexity (e.g., lines of code, dependency graphs).  
* Maintainer responsiveness (average time to merge PRs).

##### Project Health Dashboard

*Score repositories on a 1–10 scale for:*

* Community Support: Activity in discussions, clarity of documentation.  
* Maintainer Engagement: Frequency of commits, issue resolution time.

#### *2\. Contribution Portfolio & Verification System*

##### Automated PR Tracking

* Sync with GitHub to log accepted pull requests, tagging them with skills demonstrated (e.g., “API Integration,” “Unit Testing”).  
* Impact Metrics: Lines of code contributed, issues resolved, projects affected.

##### Visual Analytics Dashboard

*Interactive charts showing growth in:*

* Technical Breadth: Languages/frameworks used over time.  
* Project Depth: Contributions to high-impact vs. small-scale projects.

##### Exportable Experience Reports

*Generate polished PDFs/LinkedIn-ready summaries with:*

* Skill heatmaps, project testimonials from maintainers, and difficulty-tiered achievements.

#### *3\. Skill Development Engine*

##### Interactive Git Tutorials:

Step-by-step labs teaching version control basics:

* Hands-on modules: Commit workflows, branching, resolving merge conflicts.  
* Simulated PR Practice: Mock repositories for creating “first pull requests” in a sandbox environment.

Progress Tracking: Badges for completing milestones (e.g., “Git Navigator,” “Conflict Resolver”).

##### Open Source Etiquette Guide:

Video tutorials and quizzes on:

* Writing clear issue descriptions.  
* Communicating with maintainers (e.g., How to ask for code reviews).  
* Licensing basics and code attribution.

##### Mentorship Network

Connect students with experienced OSS developers for code reviews and career advice.

##### Gamified Milestones

Badges like “Database Architect” (5+ merged SQL PRs) or “Open Source Advocate” (mentoring new contributors).

#### *4\. Maintainer Ecosystem Tools*

##### Beginner-Onboarding Toolkit

Templates for good-first-issue labels, contribution guidelines, and Discord/Slack integration for community support.

##### Student Outreach Dashboard

Metrics on contributor diversity, PR success rates, and tools to recognize top student contributors (e.g., “Rising Star” awards).

### *Target Audience*

## *RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT*

### *Proposed Tech Stack*

| *Layer* | *Tools* | *Rationale* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Frontend | SvelteKit (SSR \+ SPA) | Lightweight, SEO-friendly, built-in routing, and edge-compatible rendering. |
| Backend | Hono.js (Edge-first) \+ Python (FastAPI for ML/analytics) | Hono.js for low-latency API routes; FastAPI for CPU-heavy tasks (AI scoring). |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Primary) \+ Redis (Caching) | PostgreSQL for relational data (users, contributions); Redis for API cache. |

### *Data Flow Diagram*

\[User\] → \[OpenPath SvelteKit Frontend\] (OAuth) → \[GitHub API\] → \[PostgreSQL (Cached Repo Metadata, User Stats)\]  →  (Webhooks) \[Backend (Hono.js)\] → \[Redis (Issue/PR Cache)\]  → \[Analytics (FastAPI)\] → \[S3 (Exportable Reports)\] 

### *Feasibility Check*

#### *1\. Authentication*

##### Proposed:

GitHub OAuth (with read:user and repo scopes).

##### Key Checks:

* Ensure OAuth grants access to user public contributions (requires repo scope for private activity).  
* Handle users without GitHub accounts: Provide in-app tutorials (e.g., “Create Your First GitHub Account”).

#### *2\. GitHub API Integration*

##### Required Endpoints:

GET /user/repos (OSS repos)    
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues (filter by labels, e.g., "good-first-issue")    
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/languages    
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/contributors 

##### Rate Limits:

* Authenticated users: 5,000 requests/hour.  
* Critical for scalability: Cache responses aggressively (Redis).

##### Gaps:

* No native API for “project health scores” → Derive metrics via:  
* Custom scoring algorithm (e.g., last\_commit\_age \+ open\_issue\_ratio).

#### *3\. Database vs. REST-Only Approach*

##### Database Required For:

* Caching GitHub API responses (avoid rate limits).  
* Storing user profiles, contribution history, and skill tags.  
* Precomputing project health scores (updated via cron jobs).

##### Scraping Necessity:

* Only if GitHub API lacks data (e.g., historical PR abandonment rates).  
* Use official API first; scrape sparingly (legality risk\!).

### *Key Technical Risks & Mitigations*

| *Risk* | *Mitigation* |
| :---- | :---- |
| GitHub API rate limiting | Implement Redis caching (TTL: 1–24 hrs) \+ user-specific quota tracking. |
| Slow project health scoring | Precompute scores nightly via background workers (e.g., Cloudflare Queues). |

### *Additional Feasibility Checks to Add*

##### Real-Time Sync Feasibility:

* Can GitHub webhooks reliably trigger updates (e.g., new PRs/issues)?  
* Fallback: Poll GitHub API every 15 mins for critical events.

##### Third-Party Dependencies:

* Legal review of GitHub’s API Terms of Service (e.g., scraping restrictions).  
* Backup plan if API changes (e.g., deprecated endpoints).

##### Performance Benchmarks:

Test API response times for:

* Cold starts (Hono.js on Cloudflare Workers).  
* Complex queries (e.g., filtering 10K+ issues by language \+ difficulty).
